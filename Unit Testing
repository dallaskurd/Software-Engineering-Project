// I'm not sure how to implement a method test for our program because the only has adding and deleting events but here goes.


Public class CalendarTest{
//Do we need to create a calendar or can we just write a method to create lots of events from the //starting of the app?
@Before
MainActivity TestActivity;
Events testEvent;
}

@Test
//This first test is to try and overload the add function for a single day.
//The idea is that it will try and create an event for every minute of the day
Public void AddTest(){
String TimeOfday = “AM”;
Int hour = 12;
//hour is just a counter, hour used is the 
For(int militaryhour = 0; militaryhour < 24; militaryhour++){
	For(int minute = 1; minute < 60; minute++){
testEvent.addEvent(“test1”,”Location”,”Description”, “Test Category”, hour, (minute-1), “AM”, ”12/08/15”, hour, minute, “AM” , “no”);}
	if(hour == 12)
	{	hour = 1; }
