Safer Muhammet added Muhammad Habib, Jason Rummel, and Zach Miller to the group. 
 
Safer Muhammet
Hey guys, I've created this group to make it easier for us to collaborate during the progression of the project. 
If anyone has ideas for which topic to choose, please share it here so we can all see and discuss. 
Sep 13, 4:30pm 
 
Muhammad Habib
Did anyone email the TA the names of our group members? 
Sep 13, 5:42pm 
 
Safer Muhammet
I haven't, I will do that right now to make it official. 
Can someone provide the TA contact info as I can't find it on the blackboard course. 

Jason Rummel
You can email the ta by clicking on utdallas email on the left and click the ta button. 
They have not given us the actuall email yet 
 
Safer Muhammet
Yeah it shows Wang, Chaoran as the TA, but no actual email is shown. I will still send a message with our names so he is aware and we at least tried. 
 
That's what I sent, let me know if anything needs to be added. Also, once we choose a topic/app to work on for our project than I can email the TA that too. 
Sep 13, 7:08pm 
 
Muhammad Habib
Do all of you guys have what's app? 
 
Safer Muhammet
No, I think groupme is going to be the best portal for us to communicate and collaborate on. It's designed for group communication and what's up is a alternative phone/message app. That's my personal opinion, but it's up to you guys. 
Sep 15, 11:17am 
Zach Miller is new to GroupMe and hasn't responded, so we stopped sending them messages from this group. 
 
Jason Rummel
BTW won't be at SE today. Have to pick sister up from airport 
Sep 15, 11:31am 
Zach Miller has rejoined the group 

Zach Miller
No worries man 
Sep 15, 6:28pm 
 
Muhammad Habib
So we have an option between message app, contact app, and what was the last one? 
 
Jason Rummel
Calender app 
 
Muhammad Habib
Thanks 
Sep 15, 10:53pm 
 
Muhammad Habib
 
We are not on that list 
 
Safer Muhammet
Seen it, I'll send him another message by replying to this one. I'm sure he's reaching out bc we sent him a email via blackboard and noticed no one else was doing so, so he just sent a mass email. 
 
Muhammad Habib
OK cool 
Sep 15, 11:45pm 
 
Muhammad Habib
Guys we are not a group anymore 
He assigned us group 
Crap 
 
Jason Rummel
Odd 
 
Safer Muhammet
Dude this guy is an idiot, I swear. I'm writing him a email now to fix the grouping. 
 
Muhammad Habib
Lol 
I don't wanna join people now... 
 
Jason Rummel
Ok was about to write to him too. Ikr 
 
Muhammad Habib
We already had a good group thing going 
Sep 16, 12:29am 
 
Muhammad Habib
And we are back together 
Cudos to whoever emailed him 
 
Jason Rummel
Nice 
 
Safer Muhammet
I'm glad to see that 
Sep 18, 12:42pm 
 
Jason Rummel
Any thought on the topic? 
Sep 18, 1:03pm 

Zach Miller
I haven't found an example of a calendar Java app yet but I have found a few different implementations of calendar events in Java. 
Sep 18, 1:23pm 
 
Safer Muhammet
Will I'm thinking we just choose the calendar app since it's something that makes fundamental since to all of us. The concepts and abstractions for classes and methods don't seem impossible. I vote calendar app, tell me what you guys think. 
 
Safer Muhammet
Worst case we can look at the android calendar app since the source code is open source haha 
 
Jason Rummel
That works for me 
 
Safer Muhammet
Cool 

Zach Miller
Yea lets do the calendar app 
 
Safer Muhammet
Muhammad you up for it? 
 
Muhammad Habib
 
Safer Muhammet
Nice, I'll do some digging when I get home to see what I can find on Google. I'm sure or prof will talk more about the project after this first exam. 
Sep 18, 5:04pm 
 
Jason Rummel
Have we emailed the ta? Or should I 
Sep 18, 5:27pm 
 
Safer Muhammet
Go ahead and do it Jason, I just got home, am kind of burnt out to do anything at the moment. 
 
Jason Rummel
Gotcha 
 
Safer Muhammet
Thanks Jason 

Zach Miller
Yea thanks. My computer has been dead all afternoon. Appreciate it. 
 
Jason Rummel
Sent 
Our next due date is Sept 30th now 
 
Safer Muhammet
Nice, what all is due then? Domain model, class diagrams and the sort? 
 
Jason Rummel
Use case diagrams and natural language specifications. Also the class diagrams and sequence diagrams 
 
Safer Muhammet
Okay, let's pick a date and get together to discuss all the responsibilities as far as who wants to do what. I think this might be the easiest part of the actual project, but at the same time critical to the real design which will ultimately become out end product. 
Our* 
Sep 21, 4:21pm 
 
Muhammad Habib
You guys done the homework? 
 
Jason Rummel
Not yet 

Zach Miller
I have not started yet.

Safer Muhammet
I have started, it is time consuming 
 
Muhammad Habib
What number are you on? 
Sep 27, 6:11pm 
 
Muhammad Habib
We have to get started on the project 
It's worth 30% of our final grdes 
And by the looks of the grade on exam one, I'm gonna need every little point that I can get 
 
Safer Muhammet
We can all meet sometime this week for 15 minutes or so that would be great. 
 
Jason Rummel
Yea I get out of my classes on Monday and Tuesday go from 1 to 345 any other time then that I can meet

Zach Miller
Ok thanks. 
 
Safer Muhammet

Sep 30, 5:26pm 

Zach Miller
an event. 
Hey guys so this is how we are going to divide tasks. Zach - class diagram Jason - use case Muhammad - sequence create an event Safer - sequence delete 
check each other. 
And everyone please upload your files to the Google doc as soon as possible. Also if everyone can at least read through all the documents so we can error 
Sep 30, 5:36pm 
 
Muhammad Habib
I might not be able to make it 

Zach Miller
No worries as long as you do your part and upload it. 
 
Muhammad Habib
What's my part and when is it due? 
Sep 30, 6:22pm 

Zach Miller
Do a sequence diagram for "creating an event" it's due tonight b 
Sep 30, 6:54pm 
 
Safer Muhammet
I will work on it when I get home, leaving school now. You will have it before midnight. 
Sep 30, 7:17pm 

Zach Miller
Hey guys I want to ask everyone: how should we represent time as classes? 
 
Jason Rummel
What do u mean, like the start time then as a string 

Zach Miller
views (months, weeks...). 
I was originally thinking to make all units of time through parent classes from year to minutes. Then have calendar include them in its representation of 
Or is that going to far? 
 
Jason Rummel
Too far java has most of that already in the library 
Sep 30, 7:37pm 

Zach Miller
Shouldn't we make classes out of monthly, weekly and daily views? 
Sep 30, 7:44pm 
 
Jason Rummel
Mabye, I don't know. If they have enough variables and methods then yea 

Zach Miller
ould be classes so we can have them as places to view events. Right? 
Well I'm just thinking that we are going to create an object for the view we choose. It will never be a calendar but one of the three options. So they sh 
 
Muhammad Habib
It due tonight? 

Zach Miller
Yes 
 
Muhammad Habib
I have an exam tomorrow and the day after that...anyway I can get something else 
You know I'll try my best to finish it 
Do I submit it online? 

Zach Miller
Save it to the Google doc folder. They all have to be submitted together. 
 
Muhammad Habib
The earliest I'll be done is 11 

Zach Miller
Try. Please. The sequence diagram really isn't too much work. 
 
Muhammad Habib
Yeah I'll get it done...so you just want me to submit a screen shot of that on Google docs? 

Zach Miller
Jason I added a first draft of the class diagram to the Google doc. Can you have a look so we can discuss. 
Yes Muhammad. That would be great. 
Sep 30, 8:27pm 
 
Muhammad Habib
I'm done 
I do I submit it on docs? 
How 

Zach Miller
You should have received an invitation to the folder a few days ago open it and save it in the appropriate document. 
Sep 30, 8:50pm 

Zach Miller
Also can you have a quick look at the class diagram and the natural language docs. That way we check each other. 
Sep 30, 8:55pm 
 
Muhammad Habib
Will do 
Sep 30, 9:51pm 

Zach Miller
finished I will review and submit. Thanks for all the cooperation within the short time frame! 
Hey team. Just wanted to check in with everyone and say that I will submit these docs as a zipped file. I have talked to everyone and as soon as Safer is

Muhammad Habib
Thanks for taking charge 
Oct 11, 6:33pm 
 
Muhammad Habib

Jason Rummel
I am free after Wensday 
Oct 11, 6:41pm 
 
Safer Muhammet
I have time from Monday to Thursday and can meet any of those days to discuss project details. 
Oct 11, 6:53pm 
 
Muhammad Habib
Okay sooner, the better. Worth 30% of final grade. 
 
Safer Muhammet
Muhammad how about me and you meet tomorrow sometime and if Zach can join then even better, doesn't have to be long

Safer Muhammet
I can meet morning tell 3:30 PM, but I have class at at 4 PM until 6:45 PM. 
 
Muhammad Habib
Zach do you have any break before data structures class? 
Oct 11, 7:32pm 

Zach Miller
I work until class at 2. 
Oct 11, 7:40pm 
 
Safer Muhammet
Okay well Mohammad and I will meet and if you wanna join you can. We will try to make it so it's after 2pm but I don't know Mohammad's schedule. 
Oct 13, 1:26pm 
 
Safer Muhammet
Hey Zach here's that link you where asking about, http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/declaring-layout.html 
There is basically two ways about programming the GUI, an XML file or through runtime. With the Runtime method we basically initiate layout elements and dictate how they will interact with one another. 
I say an XML file would best suite our Calendar app as it promotes decoupling and makes it easier to do maintenance. Changing one file as opposed to several classes. 
Can each of you create an account on GitHub so I can add you as collaborators to the project. Unless Jason you have a repository created and are already contributing? 
Jason what code have you already written and do you need any help with anything so far? 
FYI: Meeting this Friday at 3:00 PM CST 
Oct 13, 1:42pm 
 
Jason Rummel
Nah I have not started one. I have been poking with the groundwork of the calendar and event classes 
Oct 13, 2:01pm 
 
Safer Muhammet
okay can you send me your email you want attached to the GitHub repo I created, so this way everyone can see whats being done so no duplicate work is done. Have you had any good ideas or insight into what we should focus on? Possibly some direction as to what needs to be done in order to achieve a stable build? 
Oct 13, 2:07pm 
 
Jason Rummel
http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2141484 it seems easy to code the non gui part of the calender in Java then just transfer it to android 
Oct 13, 2:18pm 
 
Safer Muhammet
Nice, seems like a solid method we can play around with to see what results it gives. It basically allows you to write the text statements and then customize GUI parameters to get desired outputs. It even does java to XML conversion on the fly. Seems straightforward, my only concern is does it have the "Calendar" related GUIs we need, furthermore, how much customization is needed to manipulate does GUI templates to get a ascetically looking Calendar app. I'll do some research into what there is. Keeping posting anything interesting and relative to the project. 
Jason whats your email address? 
 
Jason Rummel
Jason.a.rummel@gmail.com 
 
Safer Muhammet
sending you an invite to the GitHub repo, upload any of your work so we can all see and contribute to it.

I don't think I'm gonna come either 
My class got cancelled 

Zach Miller
Well then can you post your code to the GitHub? 
 
Muhammad Habib
I dont have much at this point 
Has safer posted his yet? 

Zach Miller
If you aren't going to meet can you work on your and submit what you have today? 
Oct 23, 1:25pm 

Zach Miller
Cool? 
Also Jason can you explain what your commit is doing with the gui? 
 
Jason Rummel
It's just an example file that I made showing one way we can do it 

Zach Miller
Is it a Java file or is it XML using the android ide? 
 
Jason Rummel
Java 
Oct 23, 1:46pm 

Zach Miller
Nice. I just ran it. Will it run smoothly with android? 
 
Jason Rummel
Mabye by using a program 
 
Safer Muhammet
I'm submitting what I've done here shortly, just making sure it'll compile and actually demonstrate a Calendar app 
Oct 25, 6:24pm 
 
Muhammad Habib
I have been trying to do my part but I suck at java and it won't run 
And I don't see anything on github? Did y'all not post anything or am I just not seeing it 
Oct 27, 1:42pm 
 
Muhammad Habib
I got it to write to a file, and the name of the file is same as the name of the event 
 
Muhammad Habib
and I cannot upload it to github becuase no one has added to the group 
Oct 27, 7:43pm 
 
Jason Rummel
Updated my gui test to have all 3 views tell me what u think 
Oct 27, 8:00pm 
 
Safer Muhammet
Will do when I get a chance 
Oct 27, 9:35pm 
 
Muhammad Habib
I put my part on github 
It asks for an event and then it saves that event to a file...and it names the file whatever the name of that even is 
Event 
Oct 27, 10:07pm 
 
Safer Muhammet
Nice 
Oct 28, 8:45pm 
 
Muhammad Habib
Y'all think we'll be done with our app by the due date? 
I mean we don't have much at the moment 
I'm just kinda worried cause it is worth 30% of our final grade 

Zach Miller
We will be done. Don't worry. 
 
Jason Rummel
^ 
Also BTW I updated the gui with buttons to add delete and edit. 
 
Safer Muhammet
Muhammad patience.. we will finish no matter what. 
 
Muhammad Habib
Lol okay......its just I got 6 classes going on so I guess I'm the only worried hahah 
And I have two other group projects due at the end of the semester lol 
Oct 28, 9:02pm 

Zach Miller
Sorry, I know it feels like we haven't gotten much accomplished but we will tackle this soon. 
Oct 28, 9:13pm 
 
Safer Muhammet
Like Zach said 
Oct 28, 9:45pm 
 
Muhammad Habib
I'm not blaming y'all lol...I know you guys are busy with work and school 

Zach Miller
Yea no one is thinking that. Just reassuring you that we all intend to make this app work well. 
Oct 29, 10:04am 

Zach Miller

Hey team, I will need to rush out of class today so I won't be able to meet. But I want to meet tomorrow at 3. I will be at the library trying to impleme 
e all weekend to collaborate. 
Oct 29, 5:08pm 
 
Jason Rummel
Updated my gui so that last and next month bottoms work, some months are buggy trying to get to the bottom of it 
Oct 29, 5:13pm 
 
Safer Muhammet
Nice, I'll start piecing your code into the project and see how it turns out 
Oct 29, 6:23pm 
 
Jason Rummel
Found why some months were not coming out properly fixing now 
Oct 29, 6:29pm 
 
Safer Muhammet
Okay good 
Oct 29, 6:48pm 
 
Jason Rummel
Ok fixed it and added a scroll bar 
Oct 29, 6:57pm 
 
Muhammad Habib
Dang...you guys are going at the code haha 
 
Jason Rummel
I have coded since 9th grade. It relaxing 
Oct 29, 7:15pm 
 
Muhammad Habib
I wish I could same the same about myself. I started coding a semester ago lolo 
Oct 29, 10:12pm 
 
Jason Rummel
Fixed a bug with my file that made Feb crash the program. 
Oct 30, 10:14am 
 
Muhammad Habib
Nice 
Oct 30, 2:16pm 

Zach Miller
Is anyone interested in meeting today? 
Oct 30, 2:22pm 
 
Jason Rummel
I can meet 
Oct 30, 2:30pm 

Zach Miller
Do you have the gui on a laptop? 
 
Jason Rummel
Nope my laptop is not workin 
Oct 30, 2:38pm 

Zach Miller
Well let's not meet. Or let me load up the work we have so if we meet we can work through following steps. 
 
Jason Rummel
One of the big things we need to decide/figure out is how to put the events on thier proper day on month view 
Oct 30, 2:45pm 

Zach Miller
I can take a stab at that. I really haven't had an assignment for the app yet. 
 
Jason Rummel
Ok use the gui test code for testing since it is easier to test with then gui 2.0 code 

Zach Miller
K 
Oct 31, 6:34pm 

Zach Miller
Jason: I'm reading online that Java,swing is not supported on android so the guy build you've made will need to have changes made if it is to be implemented. 
Safer: how did you set up a module? Or which file is it? I'm having difficulties grinning the calendar.xml 
 
Safer Muhammet
At the store, when I get home I'll send you a new project with .class files and a .apk to run. 
Should be in about an hour or so 

Zach Miller
Ok. I downloaded the zip and got understood to configure as an apk but I'm not sure how or what is needed for the module to get working. 
 
Jason Rummel
Yea been working on making a new one with xml 

Zach Miller
Ok great. I know I sound like a broken record but I would really like us to find time to meet and collaborate. I am available all day tomorrow and will b 
e more available after my test on Monday at 4. 
 
Safer Muhammet
Idk, android studio sometimes doesn't compile unless everything with gradle is matching specifically with the project parameters. I've had trouble replicating results on other PCs. 
Okay, I will be working on this all day tomorrow as I have been working on my project 3 for 3345 data structures class. 

Zach Miller
No worries on having other schoolwork. I just don't want everyone to be working alone potentially on the same thing. And I want to make sure we are on th 
e same page with the implementation. 
 
Muhammad Habib
I have would like to meet but I have 4 exams back to back this upcoming week. So if y'all want me do anything let me know 
 
Safer Muhammet
Your 100% right on that, wouldn't want wasted effort. 
 
Muhammad Habib
I don't if that was sarcastic or what lol 
 
Safer Muhammet
No, it was me agreeing with Zach. Lol 
Oct 31, 6:56pm 

Zach Miller
Lol just straight talk. Jason if you post something will you send out a message so I can try it out ? 
 
Jason Rummel
Of course, hopefully I will have a skeleton tonight 
Oct 31, 11:16pm 
 
Jason Rummel
Ok uploaded. Make use you use android studio and make a new project with a blank activity named main activity and update the files you will get with my code make sure to to over copy your first line in the Java file 
The files are in the folder android gui test 
It only has month done. You click on a date and a pop up with the events. Swipe left to get where week view will go 
Nov 1, 1:21pm 
 
Jason Rummel
Updated it, now the different event categories are different colors 
Nov 1, 1:43pm 
 
Jason Rummel
Day view works, just have to add events 
Nov 1, 2:00pm 

Zach Miller
Great. I have a study group at 230 but I will have a look afterward. 
Nov 1, 2:55pm 
 
Jason Rummel
Week view is done, just have to add events 
Nov 1, 6:31pm 
 
Jason Rummel
Added a do to list to the read me. If you working on something on the list put ur name next to it so we can see. If I am missing something add it 
 
Safer Muhammet
Very smart idea Jason 
Nov 2, 6:44pm 
 
Jason Rummel
I moved the edit and delete button to if you click on an event then they pop up just an fyi. 
Nov 3, 10:11am 
 
Muhammad Habib
We don't have class today right? 
 
Jason Rummel
Have not seen anything that said we don't have class 

Zach Miller
Our professor isn't coming his Ta is going to answer questions and maybe review materials.

I think your supposed to put a 1 though 
 
Muhammad Habib

Jason Rummel
Yep 
1 sounds good 
Nov 6, 1:29pm 
 
Muhammad Habib

Nov 6, 1:40pm 

Zach Miller

Muhammad Habib
Okay 12 sounds goor 
How long do y'all plan on staying 
Nov 6, 1:50pm 

Zach Miller
We have a lot of work to do. There really is no good time estimation. But I would like to make sure this project is 90% done by tomorrow night. 
 
Muhammad Habib
Okay sounds good 
Nov 6, 10:49pm 
 
Jason Rummel
Hey, so my laptop is under the weather, so if someone else could bring one with android studio on it that would be great if not we could probably figure something out 
Nov 7, 10:52am 
 
Muhammad Habib
How long do we plan on staying? Because I need to tell my group for comp arch class when I will be coming... 
Nov 7, 11:08am 
 
Jason Rummel
I don't think more then 50 min 
Nov 7, 11:14am 

Zach Miller
You think it will only take that long? 
 
Jason Rummel
I mean, we are just making sure everyone knows what they are doing and making sure that they can run the code in studio I mean there not much else to do unless u think we should group program which would not be effective 
Nov 7, 11:57am 
 
Muhammad Habib
What room? 
Nov 7, 12:08pm 

Zach Miller
Get one if you are in the library 
 
Jason Rummel

Muhammad Habib
I'm struggling with my part 
Nov 8, 5:56pm 
 
Jason Rummel
BTW we do need unit tests 
So we should do those Wensday 

Zach Miller
Unit tests? 
 
Muhammad Habib
I just don't know how to check if there is an event already there...I suck at java 
Nov 8, 6:11pm 

Zach Miller
Muhammad. Want to meet after class tomorrow and work out your issue? 
Nov 8, 6:31pm 
 
Muhammad Habib
I'll let you know tomorrow for sure cause I may have to meet one of my professor at that time 
Still waiting for him to reply back 
Nov 10, 8:35am 

Zach Miller
Hey team. I really would like for us to talk today about our progress. I have an almost working holiday checking block. But I have some questions for Jas 
on. Also safer hasn't seen the working app so I would like to show it to him. 
Nov 10, 11:16am 
 
Jason Rummel
I won't be at class since 8 am getting my classes for next semester but I should be done by the end of it, so I can meet yall at the end 

Zach Miller
Ok 
Nov 10, 11:42am 
 
Safer Muhammet
Cool, where getting our test back today and going over it like last time. 
Nov 10, 3:41pm 

Zach Miller
How is everything coming? Safer? Jason: did you have a chance to look at the holiday statements? 
 
Safer Muhammet
I'm starting to sort out all my android studio/sdk manager issues. I've got a skeleton for my event class and am slowly adding and testing some methods. 
Nov 10, 4:03pm 

Zach Miller
He sent an email saying we don't need to have the junit tests finished until the 7th of December. 
Nov 10, 4:09pm 
 
Jason Rummel
Awesome 
Nov 10, 4:53pm 

Zach Miller
But we do need to submit a read me 
Nov 10, 5:42pm 
 
Muhammad Habib
Guys I'm sorry. Something very unexpected has come up and I don't think I'll be able to finish that part by deadline. Again I'm very sorry. 
Nov 10, 5:52pm 

Zach Miller
Can you go meet up with Safer in the computer lab? 
 
Muhammad Habib
I'm not at school. I don't think I'm gonna be making it home any time soon 
Please don't think I'm trying to avoid work..... Sorry 

Zach Miller
It's ok man. Take care. 
 
Safer Muhammet
Okay, I'm still here at the lab and will be working on it tell I can get some results. 
Nov 10, 6:04pm 
 
Safer Muhammet
Zach, I'm headed home to get something to eat. Don't worry I'll be working on this when I get refueled. Also, I've got an event class created, but am unsure on how it will interact with our current version of the app, can't really check as my Android Studio is still unable to build the version on github. Downloading and installing all the packages in SDK Manager didn't help solve anything inside Android Studio either, just so you know. 
I've also got a primitive version of my app available, nothing fancy. I'll post a download link to the .apk and you guys can try it on the emulator or your phone. 
https://www.dropbox.com/s/3sso5az4vhb5o19/Calendar.apk?dl=0  Calendar.apk 
Zach, let me know if you need anything from me. Jason that goes for you too 
Nov 10, 7:10pm 

Zach Miller
Cool. Jason- have you had an opportunity to work on the code? 
Nov 10, 7:24pm 
 
Jason Rummel
Yea been cleaning it up and stopping it from crashing. 
 
Jason Rummel
If u commit the holidays chide I can look at it if u want 

Zach Miller
I made a commit to a new branch this afternoon. So the holidays should be posted. 
 
Jason Rummel
Ahh now I see ot 
It* 

Zach Miller
Ok great. I am going to put a rough draft of the README together. Safer: is the conflict code coming together? 
Nov 10, 7:37pm 
 
Safer Muhammet
Working on that now Zach 
Nov 10, 8:02pm 
 
Jason Rummel
The holiday does not like if there is nothing on that day yet. Trying to fix it 
Nov 10, 8:09pm 
 
Jason Rummel
Fixed it want. Committing soon 
Nov 10, 8:16pm 
 
Jason Rummel
Committed 
Planning on changing the format so the events are listed by start time 
 
Safer Muhammet
Okay I'm still working on my bit of event class 
Nov 11, 2:39pm 

Zach Miller
Hey Jason can you meet soon? 
 
Jason Rummel
yea, What's up 

Zach Miller
I just want to finish the app and review with you. 
Nov 11, 3:09pm 

Zach Miller
Ethics quiz code 8310 
Nov 11, 3:37pm 

Zach Miller
Jason I would really like to see the app working on a pc. Can I come see you working version on your computer? 
 
Jason Rummel
I don't run it on a pic just android studio 
A pc * 

Zach Miller
That's what I mean. Through android studio. 
 
Jason Rummel
It looks the same as yours, 
 
Jason Rummel
Since I don't use an emulator 
It's just code 

Zach Miller
Because of the limitations of my computer, I can't get an accurate preview within android studio. 
 
Jason Rummel
What do u mean by that like a gui preview? Cuz I can't run an emulator since I don't have enough mem 

Zach Miller
I would like for us to get together to finalize this project. I think it would be easiest to ensure it works best. 
Yes the gui preview. 
 
Jason Rummel
So you want us to group code? Cuz that does not work well 
The gui preview does not work with the sliding on the computer w/o an emulator 
 
Safer Muhammet
Jason can you please send or post your code, the one with the latest changes (working version) so I begin to integrate the event stuff into it 
 
Jason Rummel
I did 
 
Safer Muhammet
On git? 
 
Jason Rummel
Yep on the zach branch 
Last night 

Zach Miller
I just want us to work together and all see the final product working. 
 
Safer Muhammet
Okay wasn't looking there 
 
Jason Rummel
So u want all of us to gather around my pc and code it? 
Nov 11, 4:00pm 
 
Safer Muhammet
We can try that but where is everyone going to be later? 

Zach Miller
I'll be around. We could meet in that computer lab? 
 
Safer Muhammet
Sure, I've got classes today that end at 6:45 
 
Jason Rummel
That works for me 
Nov 11, 4:12pm 

Zach Miller
Hey Jason, sorry if I was imposing. 
 
Jason Rummel
No it was fine, I was just confused on the why 

Zach Miller
Let's meet at 7 in that lab after Safer's class. 
 
Jason Rummel
Will do 
 
Safer Muhammet
Okay got it 
Nov 11, 6:53pm 
 
Safer Muhammet
Headed there now. 
Nov 11, 7:26pm 
 
Muhammad Habib
I'm sorry. I won't be able to come. 
Nov 11, 8:01pm 

Zach Miller
Hey Jason how's it going over there? 
Nov 11, 8:17pm 
 
Jason Rummel
Good bout to commit the recurrence 
Nov 11, 8:34pm 

Zach Miller
Hey man can you message me on gchat? There is no reception in this lab and we have some questions. 
Millerlonghorn@gmail.com 
Nov 11, 10:00pm 

Zach Miller
Hey Jason can you come back for a minute? 
 
Jason Rummel
Sure 
Nov 11, 10:42pm 
 
Safer Muhammet
hey jason I just posted the category method, please take a look at it and tell me if it works 
Nov 11, 11:17pm 
 
Safer Muhammet
Hey did you find the bug? 
 
Jason Rummel
Yea testing it right now 
 
Safer Muhammet
okay if you don't mind go ahead and submit it so that way we have something turned in and we can resubmit 
 
Jason Rummel
K 
 
Safer Muhammet
public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
    View view = super.getView(position, convertView, parent);
int i = 0;
    TextView myText = (TextView) view;
    myText.setGravity(Gravity.CENTER);
while (!(events[i].getName().equals(myText.getText()))) {
        i++;
    }
while (!(events[i].getCategory().equals(""))) {
        i++;
if (events[i].getCategory() == "Family") {
            myText.setTextColor(Color.BLUE);
        } else if (events[i].getCategory() == "School") {
            myText.setTextColor(Color.RED);
        } else if (events[i].getCategory() == "Work") {
            myText.setTextColor(Color.MAGENTA);
        } else {
            myText.setTextColor(Color.DKGRAY);
        }
    }
return view;
}
check that out, it will color the text based on the string of the category 
 
Safer Muhammet
so "Family", "School" or "Work" will be colored 
 
Jason Rummel
Ok commit it, looks good 
My fix did not work BTW but will submit W/o it and fix it b4 then 
 
Safer Muhammet
that's fine, it so we have something on there 
Nov 11, 11:33pm 
 
Safer Muhammet
Any luck? 
 
Jason Rummel
It's freezing any time I touch a day with a holiday 
Nov 11, 11:44pm 
 
Jason Rummel
Fixed, submitting 

Zach Miller
Hey Jason we are calling it a day. I committed a read me file. Submit what you have when you are ready. 
Nov 11, 11:52pm 
 
Jason Rummel
I submitted it 
Nov 12, 12:42pm 

Zach Miller
Hey Jason are you available on Saturday to work on the code more? Based on the presentations, being 'done' by last night isn't the expectation. 
 
Jason Rummel
Yep 
 
Safer Muhammet
Great I will be there too 
Nov 12, 1:09pm 
 
Muhammad Habib
How close are we to actually being done? 
Nov 12, 1:15pm 
 
Safer Muhammet
So we have a running version, meaning some bugs and latent features still need to be implemented. But it's presentable in the state that it's in, though I recommend we improve on it. 
Nov 12, 1:33pm 
 
Jason Rummel
I agree, we can change it from what we have submitted right? 
 
Safer Muhammet
Yes, I'm in the lab right now and when I get sometime I'll start working on it. 
 
Jason Rummel
Nice. Hopefully once my classes are done I can fix and finish the recurrence 
Nov 12, 3:12pm 
 
Muhammad Habib
do you all have to submit the project or just one of us? 
Nov 12, 3:31pm 
 
Safer Muhammet
Sorry crappy reception in the lab. No I believe it's one person out of the entire group 
 
Jason Rummel
I submitted it for all of us last night 
 
Muhammad Habib
okay thanks 
 
Safer Muhammet
np 
Are you going to be free over the weekend Mohammad? 
Can you put together a powerpoint and some basic documentation on the app? Just some crude stuff to highlight the functionality of the app. 
 
Muhammad Habib
yeah sure. I can do that 
 
Safer Muhammet
This way we have something done on that front 
 
Muhammad Habib
on google docs or regular powerpoint? 
 
Safer Muhammet
do one on google docs that way everyone can contribute and see it 
 
Muhammad Habib
okay 
 
Safer Muhammet
up to you on what the content of the pp should be 
just make it look pretty and good flow 
is that to much? I don't want overwhelm you with work, but we need this bad since it's worth 10 % and we need every point we can get 
I'll be in the lab on Saturday so if anybody wants to join me their more than welcome. Jason keep doing what your doing and please let us know if you need anything done with programming or ideas, whatever 
Nov 13, 5:44pm 

Zach Miller

Nov 29, 9:03pm 

Zach Miller
Ok cool. Did anyone make any changes to the app since we met last? 
 
Safer Muhammet
I tried doing event conflicts, but the method couldn't pull events from the memory to compare them since the events are saved awkward. 
Other than that no

Muhammad Habib
Have y'all looked at the PowerPoint

Just to let everyone know, I'm just getting home from taking my mom to her doctors appointment in Irving and will be hopefully finishing up the event conflicts. 
Later today 
 
Muhammad Habib
Is she OK? 
 
Safer Muhammet
Yeah, new doctor and so they have to do their due diligence. Plus, they kept us waiting for two hours. Worst nursing staff I've ever seen 
Dec 4, 9:25pm 

Zach Miller
How's it going safer? 
 
Safer Muhammet
Still working on it, everytime I think I'm almost done I end up finding something else to add 
Dec 5, 2:08pm 

Zach Miller
Muhammad did you get the first 100 lines of the javadoc completed? 
Dec 5, 2:18pm 
 
Safer Muhammet
Still working on events, I should be done today. 
Dec 5, 10:59pm 
 
Safer Muhammet
Jason, I add some lines of code to the main activity inside the add () function which basically do what we talked about and I also added a eventConflict method to the events class that is incomplete, but is almost done. Can you check it out and make sure what I've done looks correct. Thanks 
Does* 
All that remains is parsing through the files found and comparing boundaries on their start and end times. 
I've added lots of comments to make it easy to understand my decisions for doing things 
Those commits are on github, you might have to import a few libraries from apache since I used a few of their methods. They had the only api to do wildcarded file searches. 
Actually I think android studio will automatically generate those import once you save the file or compile. Please let me know what you think, thanks. 
I'll finish up the remaining bit of the eventConflict () method and we should be done with conflicts 
Dec 5, 11:41pm 
 
Jason Rummel
Why have event conflict in events it would be easier to be on main since you can just parse though an array of events for that day not all the files 
Also you can put the first add in an if statement with event conflicts as the argument you won't have to delete or add a second event. Ex.
If (!eventconflicts)
addevent
Exit out if add method
 
Muhammad Habib
Wait I was almost done with javadoc 
Should I not do them 
 
Jason Rummel
Nah, you just might have to do some more when we add more methods 
Dec 5, 11:55pm 
 
Safer Muhammet
Let me finish what I have and then implement it tomorrow and check if it works. The way I did it I considered events to be stored so just in case you close the app the list of events inside the array list within the main activity is gone, but events are still stored in files, so it would make since to check against the files rather than a array list which can be wiped (nulled) when the app is terminated. You want to check against your database 
Not your cached temporary storage. 
 
Muhammad Habib
No I would have to redo 
Cause I didn't edit the files y'all posted... 
I just created new ones to be safe 
What files did you guys change? 
 
Safer Muhammet
You need to have the first addEvent since data is passed over to the event class and can than be manipulated. The event class is not persistently having data referenced and updated. So for that you need that add to pass that data over into the event class so your ev instance can than be tested against that data. Does that make since. The way the classes are laid out makes it hard to do what your wanting, if I do it your way it would be bandaging 
 
Jason Rummel
The array re populates itself with events from the databaseand returns only the events of that day/parameters when ever the method is called. It just would save time coding. Since yall u would have to do is write the if statements 
It's fine the way u are doing it. 
Sun, 12:17am 
 
Safer Muhammet
Believe me I tried doing it other ways, but this is the best way and the least coding is involved. When you mean the array is repopulated, I'm assuming your talking about dayevents. Correct me if I'm wrong, but i don't think dayEvents is repopulated nor is it refurnished with events from the files created from an earlier app runtime. 
 
Jason Rummel
I am talking about getdayevents it runs a pass on the file and get all the events from the day.month year you want and returns an array. Glad you found a way 
 
Safer Muhammet
Okay, I'll have a look tomorrow and finish up 
Thanks Jason 
Sun, 3:24pm 
 
Jason Rummel
Recurrence is done 
 
Safer Muhammet
Really? Wow you work fast, nice! 
 
Muhammad Habib
What file is that under? 
 
Jason Rummel
I have not committed it yet about to 
 
Muhammad Habib
Ok 
Btw nice job 
Is it its own file though? 
Btw what should I do with javadoc files. I created a hem speealty just so I wouldn't mess anything up that y'all did? Like do y'all get what I'm saying? 
 
Jason Rummel
It's just a couple more if statments. I will branch it and we can combine em 
Sun, 4:05pm 
 
Muhammad Habib
hey jason was it you that told me that you didn't do to well on the exams in comp arch but you still ended up with an A in the class? 
 
Jason Rummel
Yea 
 
Muhammad Habib
so what all did you do to get that a? and how were your exam scores? 
 
Jason Rummel
I did all the hmk extra credit and got a 100 my exam scores were about 56 to 60 
A 100 on my project* 
 
Muhammad Habib
okay oh...56 to 60 range before or after the corrections???? 
i have been doing all of that and we did really good on our project too 
we also added sound to our project 
also how long ago did you take this class? 
 
Jason Rummel
1 year ago 
 
Muhammad Habib
thanks 
Sun, 4:20pm 
 
Jason Rummel
For recurrence monthly reoccurs on that date every month. Weekly reoccurs every week on that weekday of the original event. Any thing else I need to add to it? 
Sun, 4:28pm 
 
Muhammad Habib
Do we need a yearly reoccurs like for bdays 
 
Jason Rummel
Will do 
Sun, 5:07pm 
 
Safer Muhammet
The yearly, monthly and daily recurrence is all we need or should be good enough 
Sun, 5:43pm 
 
Jason Rummel
Done. Recurrence was just like 3 if statments 
Sun, 5:59pm 
 
Muhammad Habib
Have y'all done anything to events file other than add the event conflict method? 
Sun, 6:06pm 
 
Jason Rummel
I add a couple of things 
Just a pram to the constructor and added writing recurrence to the file. 
 
Muhammad Habib
Can you please upload that to github 
 
Jason Rummel
Yea at dinner will do when I get hme 
 
Muhammad Habib
OK 
Sun, 10:10pm 
 
Muhammad Habib
are we completely done with everything? 
 
Safer Muhammet
Not everything, still working on the final if else statements for the conflicts. 
 
Muhammad Habib
then after that we are done? 
and how are we supposed to do the testing? 
 
Safer Muhammet
Yeah 
 
Muhammad Habib
have yall studied for the exam? 
 
Safer Muhammet
Not much really 
 
Muhammad Habib
how are we supposed to do the testing? 
Sun, 10:36pm 
 
Safer Muhammet
Well figure it out, we until tomorrow night. 
Sun, 11:04pm 
 
Muhammad Habib
ok 
11:10am 
 
Muhammad Habib
what's the plan? cause I got 2 exams and a project also due tomorrow? 
 
Muhammad Habib
i heard people are bsing the testing part cause apprently its too time consuming 

Zach Miller
Let's make time to talk through the last few items that are due. 
 
Muhammad Habib
i believe they said everything is done wxpect for testing 
i think you already wrote the manual right? 

Zach Miller
I think there are two different docs required. Let me check. 
 
Muhammad Habib
i can meet anytime before 6:45 
11:43am 
 
Jason Rummel
I can meet anytime b4 6 

Zach Miller
Yea we need a README that is a summary of the content we are submitting. But it should be easy enough to take care of. I can meet at 5 or any time after 3. 
 
Muhammad Habib
So 3? 
 
Jason Rummel
Works for me 
11:56am 

Zach Miller
Let's plan on 3 but make sure Safer can attend. 
 
Muhammad Habib
Can you upload the latest event and main files 
So I can finish the javadoc 
1:05pm 
 
Muhammad Habib
I'm in ecs 
Let me know when y'all get here 
2:26pm 
 
Jason Rummel
I committed my code and combined with safers. Safer look at what I changed about event conflict and tell me if u like it. 
 
Safer Muhammet
Will do, kind of busy with something, but I'll have a look at it as soon as I can 
 
Jason Rummel
That's fine it just a touch up 
2:35pm 
 
Safer Muhammet
Thanks Jason 
3:08pm 
 
Jason Rummel
At ecs 
 
Muhammad Habib
forth floow 
back corner 
3:15pm 

Zach Miller
In the lab? 
 
Muhammad Habib
4th floor 
Same place as that one night you me and safer were 
4:15pm 
 
Jason Rummel
He said no :( 
 
Muhammad Habib
Me too 
4:22pm 
 
Safer Muhammet
Jason I just looked at the code, so you used the holiday flag to set conflicts within events. Clever, have you implemented it to see if it worked? 
 
Jason Rummel
It does, it's just there since holidays go all day so they don't mess it up 
All that's left is the if statements 
4:33pm 
 
Safer Muhammet
So just check if holiday flag is set and if so it's a conflict correct? 
 
Jason Rummel
No the flag is just there to make sure not to include holidays when looking for conflicts 
 
Safer Muhammet
Oh okay, I'll add the remaining bit of the code. I wrote a separate program to test parsing and reading in data to make sure what I was writing was actually what I was expecting the code was doing. 
6:33pm 
 
Jason Rummel
Any code still needed? 
6:59pm 
 
Safer Muhammet
No, I'm I'm still working on a few lines giving me trouble. 
8:08pm 

Zach Miller
I just commit a change to our read me to now have the requirements he asked for. 
Anyone feel free to edit it. We still need to commit a javadoc and testing then if safer finishes we should be ready to submit. 
8:28pm 
 
Jason Rummel
Are categories done or should i? 
8:39pm 

Zach Miller
I'm not with safer so I'm not sure how his progress is coming. 
8:51pm 

Zach Miller
Lets give him 15 more to respond before you take a crack at it. Also I have one small test written but I'm not sure it would even run if we implemented it. 
9:15pm 
 
Safer Muhammet
Jason have a look at my new eventConflict method, its very long 
I added lots of comments to it to help 
It basically looks for all files (events) with the same date, then it copies the fifth (start time info) and seventh line (end time info). It then does some comparisons between the event info entered by the user for the event that's currently being created. If any conflicts are found, it sets conflict to true and escapes returning a true for an eventConflict and warning the user a conflict was found. 
 
Jason Rummel
Why look in the files when I showed you that you could just look at the array 
 
Safer Muhammet
honestly i feel more comfortable looking at the files, but if you'd think it would work better just revise the code or we can just leave it out. 
I've been looking at doing it that way since yesterday and have that way in my head so I just did it that way 
 
Jason Rummel
I mean it works both ways it would just be easier, faster and safer to just call 2 gets to get end time and start time and compare them to the possible start and end time. Also your way does not include reoccurrences 
 
Safer Muhammet
it does use the getter methods inside the events class, I simply extract the data from the files to compare against 
yeah I didn't do recurrence, i don't know how it would be implemented 
 
Jason Rummel
Look at my version just commited it 
 
Safer Muhammet
okay looking at it now 
hasn't come through yet 
 
Jason Rummel
It's a new file called test event conflicts 
 
Safer Muhammet
okay 
nice, have you implemented that to see if it'll work 
we can use that one i mean what works better 
 
Jason Rummel
It works 
 
Safer Muhammet
do put it in 
that only does start to start and end to end time comparisons right? 
 
Jason Rummel
It just needs the rest of if statements 
 
Safer Muhammet
okay I'll get working on that 
 
Jason Rummel
Yea I just copied you code and made it shorter 
 
Safer Muhammet
cool 
9:47pm 
 
Muhammad Habib
Everybody done with there part? 
9:54pm 
 
Safer Muhammet
no just a little left 
10:23pm 
 
Jason Rummel
Safer have u done category yet? I can do it in just need to know 
Ok so holidays are blue and weekend events are yellow since the requirement days weekends needs to be a different color, so I did what I thought it could mean 
 
Muhammad Habib
Are y'all making any changes to main activity or events file? 
Cause everytime I do java doc y'all update the file and the javadocs go away 
 
Jason Rummel
Prob since I still.need to do category since safer has still not told me 
 
Muhammad Habib
Wait which file? Both of them? 
 
Jason Rummel
Mabye i have figure out what do of it 
 
Safer Muhammet
events class only 
 
Muhammad Habib
Okay cool 
So is the final main activity up? 
 
Jason Rummel
Not until category are.donr 
 
Muhammad Habib
Cause its says uploaded 8 hours ago? 
 
Jason Rummel
Are done* 
 
Safer Muhammet
almost Jason working on last if else 
 
Jason Rummel
uploading what I have now. Safer is that for categories or event conflicts 
 
Muhammad Habib
Please Try to have it by 11 so I can do the javadocs 
 
Safer Muhammet
event conflicts, the one you posted I'm adding to it 
i haven't touched categories since thursday 
 
Muhammad Habib
The one called events conflicts with javadoc? 
 
Safer Muhammet
test event conflicts its a new one 
 
Jason Rummel
Then tell me earlier when I asked what the progress was. 
 
Safer Muhammet
its only the method 
i just made a commit check it out 
still a one boundary check on the event left 
 
Muhammad Habib
wait have yall been working on two different event files????? 
 
Jason Rummel
No 
1 
The file with one method is a method inside the event file 
10:42pm 
 
Safer Muhammet
Jason have a look at the test event conflicts file and see if that will work 
 
Jason Rummel
As long as you have covered even possible options that would cause an conflict it's fine 
 
Safer Muhammet
yeah it might need one more for end time, i'm still thinking on that one. its weird thinking about it lol 
 
Muhammad Habib
hey yall can do manual testing 
its allowed 
 
Jason Rummel
Ok well once if finish coding categories I can see if I can do that 
 
Safer Muhammet
 
doing my peer eval 
you all got 10! lol 
 
Muhammad Habib
take a look at the project description and you'll see it on there 
thanks dude 
 
Safer Muhammet
no problem 
looking now 

Zach Miller
Thanks for all the hard work guys. This has been quite a project. 
 
Muhammad Habib
the page before the topics 
 
Safer Muhammet
sure has 

Zach Miller
Safer could you save this conversation to a doc and post it to our repository? 
 
Safer Muhammet
sure will do 
 
Muhammad Habib
lol we are gonna do taht? 

Zach Miller
Well I think it would be a good idea to at least show some correspondence. 
 
Safer Muhammet
its dialogue that's invaluable to development of the app lol 
the* 
 
Muhammad Habib
hahahhaha 
alright then 
hey text me and let me know when yall submit the FINAL mainactivity and events files
